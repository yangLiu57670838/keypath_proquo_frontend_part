        <p><strong> <em>Member Contract</em> <em>Disputes</em></strong></p>
        <p>14.1 If a Party to a Member Contract has a dispute with the other Party in relation to the terms of the Member Contract (a "<strong>Dispute</strong>"), Proquo encourages the Parties to work together in good faith to resolve the Dispute. If the Parties cannot resolve the Dispute between them, either Party of the Parties may contact Proquo at  <a href="mailto:support@proquo.com.au">support@proquo.com.au</a> to discuss the Dispute. Proquo does not provide formal dispute resolution services, although will receive information from the Parties at to the nature of the Dispute and provide initial guidance on how the Dispute could be resolved.</p>
        <p>14.2 If the Parties cannot resolve the Dispute after following the initial steps in clause 14.1, the Parties may access formal dispute resolution services provided by the Payment Provider via the Platform (the "<strong>Dispute Resolution Services</strong>"). Parties are not obliged to access the Dispute Resolution Services for a Dispute. If a Party wishes to access the Dispute Resolution Services, they agree that they will be bound by the relevant terms in the Seller Agreement. In the event of any inconsistency with the terms of the Seller Agreement and clause 14 of the Proquo T&Cs, you agree that the Proquo T&Cs shall take precedence. Proquo provides no guarantees or warranties that a Party will be able to resolve a Dispute using the Dispute Resolution Services and is not responsible in any way for the use of the Dispute Resolution Services by a Member.</p>
        <p>14.3 If Parties do access the Dispute Resolution Services, they will be responsible for all costs associated with the Dispute Resolution Services as set out in the Seller Agreement. Parties hereby provide consent for Proquo to provide as much information to the Payment Provider as may be required in order for the Payment Provider to provide the Parties with Dispute Resolution Services. If the Parties require Proquo to take any actions to assist with resolving the Dispute, Proquo will perform those actions as long as they can be performed in compliance with these Proquo T&Cs. If the Parties do not resolve the Dispute using any of the dispute resolution methods outlined in this clause, Proquo reserves its right to suspend or terminate the Member Accounts of the Parties.</p>
        <p>14.4 In the event of a Dispute between Parties, Proquo has the right to hold any monies paid by a Party in relation to a Member Contract in the Escrow Account, until the Parties have advised Proquo that the Dispute is resolved on mutually agreed terms. </p>
        <p>14.5 Nothing in the Seller Agreement will prevent a Party from seeking urgent interlocutory relief against another Party.</p>
        <p><strong> <em>Disputes with Payment Provider</em></strong></p>
        <p>14.6 If a Member has a dispute with the Payment Provider in relation to provision of the Payment Processing Services, the Member must follow the relevant terms in the Seller Agreement that apply to disputes between Members and the Payment Provider.</p>
