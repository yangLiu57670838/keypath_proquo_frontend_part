        <p>Proquo is an interactive online platform located at <a href="http://www.proquo.com.au" target="_blank">www.proquo.com.au</a>, and any related software or application,
        which allows businesses to sell, purchase and swap services (the <span class="bolder">"Platform"</span>). In order for us to provide the
        Platform, we need to handle Personal Information provided by you. We take your privacy seriously.</p>
        <p>
        This policy (the "Privacy Policy") tells you how we collect, handle and use your Personal Information. Please read
        it carefully before using our Platform. The Privacy Policy should be read in conjunction with the Proquo Terms
        and Conditions located at <a href="http://www.proquo.com.au/terms">www.proquo.com.au/terms</a>. We comply with the <span class="bolder">Privacy Act</span> as a matter of best practice.</p>
        <p>
        This Privacy Policy may change. If we change our Privacy Policy, we will display notice of changes on our Platform.
        Please check for updates regularly.</p>
        <p>
        If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy or any updates, you should stop using the Platform.
        Otherwise, by using our Platform, you accept this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <p class="bolder" >Definitions</p>

        <p>So that our Privacy Policy is easy to read, we have defined some more terms to keep them short:</p>
        <ul>

            Platform as a registered Member or not.</li>
          <li>When we say the <span class="bolder">"Privacy Act"</span>, we mean the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) as amended by the Privacy
            Amendment Act 2000 (Cth) and the Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Act 2012 (Cth).
          </li>
          <li>When we say <span class="bolder">"Personal Information"</span>, we mean that term to include any information or opinion,
            whether true or not, about a person who is identified or whose identity can reasonably be established,
            and not limited to information in a material form.
          </li>
        </ul>



        <p>We also use some of the same definitions as listed in the Proquo T&Cs such as <span class="bolder">"Member Accounts"</span>, <span class="bolder">"Member
        Profiles"</span>, <span class="bolder">"Briefs"</span>, <span class="bolder">"Quotes"</span> <span class="bolder">"Member Contract"</span>, <span class="bolder">"Payment Provider"</span> and <span class="bolder">"Members"</span>. Please refer to the

        </p>

        <p class="bolder">1. Consent</p>
        <p>By continuing to use the Platform, you hereby consent to our collection, use and disclosure of your Personal
        Information for the purposes specified in this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <p class="bolder">2. Supply of Personal Information</p>
        <p>Before supplying us with any Personal Information, you should ensure that there are no restrictions on you doing
        so (whether under contract, under the Privacy Act or otherwise).
        We are not responsible for any mistake or negligence or other conduct on your part where you supply Personal
        Information which you are not entitled to supply, but we will take reasonable steps to destroy or de-identify any
        such wrongfully supplied Personal Information within a reasonable time after you have given us notice.</p>

        <p class="bolder">3. How do we collect Personal Information from Users?</p>
        <p>We collect Personal Information where reasonably necessary for the proper function of the Platform.
          The ways in which we may collect Personal Information include:</p>
        <ul class="list-style-alpha">
          <li> When we receive enquiries or correspondence via the Platform;</li>
          <li> When you register a Member Account via the Platform;</li>
          <li> Through the use of browser 'cookies' or trackers;</li>
          <li> When you communicate with other Users via the Platform;</li>
          <li> When you enter into transactions via the Platform;</li>
          <li> From third-party payment services, when details of your transactions with other Users via the Platform are provided to us.</li>

        </ul>


        <p>The kinds of Personal Information we may collect include your legal business name, ABN, business logo, your
        occupation and the kind of business you run, your phone number, your date of birth, your business address, your
        bank or credit card details, your personal and email addresses, your photograph or image and geographical
        information. When you browse or use our Platform, we may collect non-personal statistical information, in
        accordance with clause 15 below. Additionally, we may collect information that has not been directly solicited
        from you, and is reasonably necessary for the proper function of the Platform. Where such unsolicited
        information falls outside this reasonable necessity, we will endeavour to destroy and/or de-identify the
        information as soon as practicable. This clause does not exhaustively list the ways in which we may collect
        Personal Information or the kinds of Personal Information we may collect. We or our Payment Provider reserve
        the right to request further proof of identification before disbursing any money to you for a transaction.
        </p>
        <p>We will not ask you to provide Personal Information about your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions,
        philosophical beliefs, sexual orientation, criminal record or membership of a trade union, or your health, genetic
        or biometric information (<span class="bolder">"Sensitive Information"</span>), unless it is reasonably necessary. If you do provide us with
        Sensitive Information, for example by including it in your profile on the Platform, and it is not reasonably
        necessary for us to have that Sensitive Information, we will destroy the Sensitive Information or ensure that it is
        de-identified.</p>

        <p class="bolder">4. What Personal Information is publicly available?</p>
        <p>
          Your Member Profile will be publicly available to all Internet users whether or not they are registered as a
        Member on the Platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where a Member transacts with your via the Platform, that Member will have the opportunity to review and
        'rate' your Services (<span class="bolder">"Reviews"</span>). The Reviews will also be publicly available to all Internet users and may include
        your Personal Information. If you believe the content of a Review is inaccurate, inappropriate or otherwise
        objectionable, you may flag the Review for our attention by using the button next to each Review which will
        open a new email addressed to  <a href="mailto:support@proquo.com.au">support@proquo.com.au</a>.

        <p>Communications between you and:</p>
        <ul class="list-style-alpha">
          <li> Us will be kept private; and</li>
          <li> Other Users via instant messaging on the Platform will be private between you and that User, although
            we will be able to see the contents of those communications and we may share those communications
            with our Payment Provider (and other necessary third parties) where necessary to resolve a support or
            technical issue or a dispute.</li>
        </ul>


        <p class="bolder">5. What kind of credit card and bank account information do we collect?</p>
        <p>We (or our Payment Provider) may request, store and use credit card, bank account and other billing information
        provided by you. If you are paying for services, you will need to provide the name of the credit card holder, the
        credit card number, expiry date and applicable CCV code. If you are receiving money for services, you will need to
        provide bank account details for the account that is receiving payment, including BSB, account number, billing
        address and account name. When paying for and receiving services via the Platform, you may also be required to
        provide other credit or bank account information, at our request.
        It is very important that all credit card and billing information is accurate and up-to- date. We may ask you to
        prove that you are the genuine cardholder or bank account holder, in our discretion.</p>

        <p class="bolder">6. Can you be anonymous or use a pseudonym (false name)?</p>
        <p>
          You are not allowed to give us a pseudonym or false name when you register as a Member. This is very important
        to maintain the integrity of the Platform and protect other Users.
        You need to be signed in as a Member to make the most of the Platform, and to start selling, purchasing or
        swapping services. When you are signed in, you are not anonymous to us or to other Users.
        </p>

        <p class="bolder">7. How do we use your Personal Information once we have collected it?</p>
        <p>We may use or disclose Personal Information we collect for the following purposes:</p>

        <ul class="list-style-alpha">
          <li> To identify you and authenticate your identity;</li>
          <li> To enable you to create your Member Account and Member Profile, post Briefs on your Member
            Profile, supply Quotes, enter into Member Contracts, interact with other Users via the Platform, and
            otherwise use our Platform;</li>
          <li> To enable you to sell, purchase and swap services on the Platform;</li>
          <li> To customise the content of our Platform so that it matches your preferences and the kinds of
            businesses and services you may be interested in;</li>
          <li> To understand usage trends and patterns and improve your overall experience of the Platform;</li>
          <li> To fix problems and respond to feedback and complaints;</li>
          <li> To enforce any agreements between you and us;</li>
          <li> To enable a third party (e.g. our payment services provider) to provide you with goods or services on
            our behalf;</li>
          <li> To provide dispute resolution services to you and other Users in relation to any Member Contract or
            other disputes;</li>
          <li> To allow us to run our business and perform administrative and operational tasks such as training staff,
            risk management, software development, maintaining a database, management our relationships with
            Payment Processors and undertaking research, planning and analysis; and</li>
          <li> To contact you about the Platform or for direct marketing purposes (see paragraphs 9 and 10 below).</li>

        </ul>




        <p>
          We may share and license non-personal statistical data to third parties including advertising or analytics entities.
        We will not share or license any such information that identifies you personally, and endeavour to aggregate this
        data in such a way as will de-identify individual users.
        In addition, the Privacy Act sets down some particular situations called Permitted General Situations where your
        Personal Information may be disclosed outside of the purposes listed above. <span class="bolder">"Permitted General Situations"</span>
        include where we need to take action in relation to unlawful activity relating to our functions, to establish or
        defend a legal claim, to lessen or prevent a serious threat to public health or safety, or to assist in locating
        missing people. Other laws, or a court, might also legally compel us to disclose Personal Information.
        </p>

        <p class="bolder">8. How do we store your Personal Information?</p>
        <p>We may store your Personal Information in a variety of ways including in the cloud or other types of networked
        or electronic storage.
        We store and make back-ups of certain Personal Information to meet our tax and reporting and other
        government and administrative obligations, and to ensure that we are able to recover information if our systems
        experience a fault or outage.</p>

        <p class="bolder">9. Are we going to contact you with direct marketing?</p>
        <p>We may use your Personal Information to let you know about our current products and services, Platform
        developments, our new products and services as well as the products and services of our partners and affiliates.
        We may also send newsletters and other updates about Proquo to you. By using the Platform, you hereby
        consent to such marketing communications. In delivering such communications, we will generally contact you
        via email but may also do so via mail, telephone, instant messaging on the Platform or other electronic means.
        If you do not wish to receive direct marketing communications from us, you may <span class="bolder">opt out</span> by contacting
         <a href="mailto:support@proquo.com.au">support@proquo.com.au</a>. We will always give you an opportunity to opt out of receiving future marketing
        communications. We will process all opt-out requests as soon as possible.
        </p>

        <p class="bolder">10. When else are we going to contact you?</p>
        <p>Apart from the situations discussed at paragraph 7 above, we will contact you by email with workflow-related
        matters associated with your Projects in Progress, and otherwise when it is reasonably necessary: for example,
        when a Member is urgently trying to contact you regarding a transaction, when we need to discuss a payment,
        when you are in dispute with another Member or when we have important information about your Member Account.
        </p>
        <p>You cannot opt out of these kinds of contact except by cancelling your registration as a Member.</p>

        <p class="bolder">11. Are we going to share your Personal Information with third parties, and people overseas?</p>
        <p>
          From time to time, it may be necessary for us to share your Personal Information with third parties in order for
        you to fully utilise our Platform, including our Payment Provider, third parties within and outside Australia,
        advertisers and analytics entities. We will take reasonable measures to see that these entities will respect your
        privacy in line with the Privacy Act or its international equivalent.
        You agree that we may store and process your Personal Information on a server outside the country in which you
        live.
        </p>

        <p class="bolder">12. Are we responsible for the privacy practices of third parties, where we provide links to those third
        parties, or redirect you to those third parties?</p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by Proquo with regard to our Platform. We take no
        responsibility for the privacy practices of any third parties that we may link to, or advertise, on our Platform.
        When you make payment for a service, you will be redirected to the Platform of our Payment Provider. You can
        view the Payment Provider's privacy policy at <a href="https://promisepay.com/policies/" target="_blank">https://promisepay.com/policies/</a>.
        </p>

        <p class="bolder">13. Can you access your Personal Information, and correct it if it is wrong?</p>
        <p>You can ask us to provide you with a copy of the Personal Information we hold about you. You do not need a
        reason for asking, but we may charge you our reasonable expenses for preparing and sending you a copy of your
        Personal Information. We will try to respond to your request within a reasonable time. If the request would have
        an unreasonable impact on the privacy of others, the information is commercially sensitive, giving access would
        be unlawful or the request is frivolous or vexatious, we may not give you the Personal Information requested.
        </p>
        <p>
        We will take reasonable steps to see that the Personal Information we collect and store about you is accurate,
        up-to- date and complete. To assist us, please ensure you provide us with your correct details, and let us know if
        you believe the information we have about you is inaccurate, incomplete, out-of- date or misleading. If you
        believe the Personal Information collected or used by us or a third party is false or inaccurate, you have a right to
        have this information corrected. We will endeavour to correct this information within reasonable time, at no
        expense to you.
        </p>
        <p>
        Please email  <a href="mailto:support@proquo.com.au">support@proquo.com.au</a> with any requests for access or correction. We may need to verify your
        identity when you request your Personal Information.
        </p>

        <p class="bolder">14. How do we keep your Personal Information secure?</p>
        <p>We take the security and safety of your Personal Information seriously. We will take all reasonable steps to
        protect your information from misuse, interference and loss, and unauthorised access, modification or
        disclosure. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure
       and we cannot make that guarantee. We also cannot guarantee that the Platform will be completely free from
        viruses, surveillance or interception.
        </p>

        <p>You must also do your bit by keeping your password secret, making it hard to guess and changing it frequently.</p>

        <p>We will take reasonable steps to destroy or de-identify Personal Information when it is no longer needed. We
        may retain and use de-identified information.
        </p>

        <p class="bolder">15. Do we use cookies, trackers and analytics?</p>
        <p>We may use 'cookies' to store data on your computer. The information stored in the cookie is used to identify
        your browser or device. This enables us to operate an efficient service, to track the patterns of behaviour of
        Users of the Platform and to collect statistical information about visitors to the Website and/or the Application,
        including but not limited to IP addresses, geographical location, how you arrived at the Website and information
        about the device being used to access the Services such as the browser or operating system.
        </p>

        <p>We collect this information so that we can improve our Platform, direct the most appropriate content to you and
        remember your preferences for next time you sign in. You can modify your browser to prevent cookie use but if
        you do this, our Platform may not work properly. In addition to our use of cookies, third-party advertisers or ad
        servers may also place or recognise cookies on your browser in the course of serving advertisements to the
        Platform. The use of cookies by any such third-party advertiser or tracker is not subject to this Privacy Policy, but
        subject to the privacy policy of the relevant entity.. This data is collected through cookie technology. You may opt
        out of this collection by installing relevant browser extensions.
        </p>

        <p class="bolder">16. Will we transfer your Personal Information to anybody?</p>
        <p>If there is a sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial assets, reorganisation or
        liquidation of Proquo then, in our sole discretion, we may transfer, sell, licence or assign Personal Information
        collected to one or more relevant third parties. This may make your Personal Information subject to a different
        privacy policy and if that is the case, we will post notice of this on our Platform.
        </p>

        <p class="bolder">17. Who can I contact with questions and complaints regarding this Privacy Policy?</p>
        <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, or if you wish to request access to your Personal Information,
        correct or update you details or raise any privacy concerns you may have, please contact us at the contact details
        below.</p>

        <p>Proquo also has a formal complaints process regarding the use or misuse of your Personal Information. If you
